# Minishell
This project implements a Mini Shell, a CLI that mimics BASH using Linux Kernel system calls and IPC mechanisms like signals. It supports command execution, piping, and error handling while managing special keyboard actions. Extendable for advanced features like command history, it builds skills in system calls, IPC, and string Parsing
